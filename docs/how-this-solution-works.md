# How this solution works

Since it's an online game, we'll set up a multiplayer mode using Web Sockets.

To allow players to meet and challenge each other, we'll have a lobby.

In order to register the player score, we'll use a database.

There will be a login/register screen.

## Screens

- Login
- Register
- Lobby
- Score table
